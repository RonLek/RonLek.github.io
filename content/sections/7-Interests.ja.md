content: "<p>Apart from coding, I love writing. I write short stories and a <a href='https://rohanlekhwani.medium.com/' target='_blank' noopener>blog!</a>. I love to run marathons and won a medal for the same in Blue Brigade's - 'Run for Good Health Marathon' in March 2018. I also love to play table - tennis though I won't call myself a professional (yet :P).</p>

<p>I read a lot of books (both fiction and non-fiction) and try to complete one book per week. Some of my favorite books are - 'The Alchemist by Paulo Coelho', 'The Saint, The Surfer and The CEO by Robin Sharma' and 'Think and Grow Rich by Napolean Hill'.</p>"
